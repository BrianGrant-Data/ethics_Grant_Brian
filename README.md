# My Ethics Manifesto

## Core Principles
- Leave both client and coworkers with more available time than they had
- Increase key performance indicators for those I work with
- Underpromise but over deliver 
- Communicate road blocks
- Don’t accept payment if you don’t deliver what was promised
- Be mindful of how my work can be misused for crime and prejudice
- Seek out bias and compensate accordingly 

### Leave both client and coworkers with more available time than they had
My clients, superiors, and coworkers should have less things to manage when I’ve worked with them, not more. Applied data science should be more effective at consolidating client responsibilities and not increase them.

### Increase key performance indicators for those I work with
My clients, superiors, and coworkers have goals and my work should contribute to the same. No matter the industry, my work should progress their goals even if only to reduce the time and effort they had to put into prior tasks.

### Underpromise but over deliver 
Those who do not work directly in data science are often surprised by how much applied data science can contribute to their fields. Though I intend to contribute to that sense of “magic” about my field, I refuse to promise unrealistic results.

### Communicate road blocks
In the case that what I believed to be realistic becomes unrealistic, I will communicate this and potential solutions with the client.

### Do not accept payment if you don’t deliver what was promised
On the rare chance that I’m not able to deliver on my promise, I will waive or refund my fees.

### Be mindful of how my work can be misused for crime and prejudice
There have been many displays of data science being used to enable prejudice and other unethical if not criminal acts, often indirectly. If I believe my work will or can be used this way, I will not publicize it in any way until sufficient counter-measures are in place.

### Seek out bias and compensate accordingly
Everyone has biases, it’s inherent in its definition, however I’ll seek for these and implement measures to counteract them.
